# Unrestricted Blocks in Pre-Classic rd-132211
This simple mod makes a massive impact on this version, making the block combinations and both the grass and cobblestone/stone be in different locations, instead of what's in the actual version, where there's only grass in a specific layer.

Here's what changed from the original version:
- Added support for different block types
- Added different blocks/tiles from later pre-Classic/Early Classic versions, in order to prevent unexpected level corruption (only up to c0.0.12a_03-1, due to a level format change in 0.0.13a-dev1)
- Added two new controls in order to place grass/stone: [1] (stone) and [2] (grass)
- Changed level generation in the code, causing worlds generated in this mod to be not stone, as opposed to the unmodified version
- Removed Herobrine
